# Java Chat App

A private messaging application built entirely in Java. Designed for small groups of friends and family to send direct messages and participate in group chats â€” no external dependencies, just raw Java.

## Features (Planned & In Progress)

- Client-server architecture using TCP sockets
- Terminal-based interface (initial version)
- User registration & login
- Direct (1-to-1) messaging
- Group chat creation and participation
- Timestamps on messages
- Commands (e.g., `/msg`, `/create_group`, `/group_msg`)
- Multithreaded server for handling multiple clients
- Persistent user and group data using files
